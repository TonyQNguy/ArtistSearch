# ArtistSearch
This is a program I created in Python that implements the Spotify Developer API to search an artist's discography.
The program takes the user's input from the terminal and returns the top 9 songs of the artist they inputted.
The program also returns the albums the songs appear on and prompts the pygame GUI to display the cover art of the albums.
